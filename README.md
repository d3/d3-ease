_Easing_ is a method of distorting time to control apparent motion in animation. It is most commonly used for [slow-in, slow-out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_basic_principles_of_animation#Slow_in_and_slow_out). By easing time, [animated transitions](https://github.com/d3/d3-transition) are smoother and exhibit more plausible motion.
